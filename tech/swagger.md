# Swagger
Swagger is an API specification tool. It generates API reference documents and a web GUI for interacting with a service's API, reading from a YML configuration doc and Java code annotations (typically on REST controllers to specify responses, parameters, etc.)

This is usually exposed by navigating to a project's root and adding /swagger-ui.html to the path. (e.g. localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

The API specification can also be ingested by a Node tool called Loopback to generate JavaScript boilerplate for interacting with a service's API.
